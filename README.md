# How to Calculate formula for Hour:
    12 Hours = 360 Deg
    Therefore for 1 hour = 360 / 12 + some minutes i.e 30 deg + some minutes
    How to calculate some additional minute:
    60 min = 30 Deg (This 30 Degree is for only 1 hour)
    Therefor n min = n / 2 Deg;
    for n Hour = 30 * n + n / 2;

#How to Calculate Formula for Minute:
    60 min ---> 360 Deg 
    1 min ----> 6 Deg 
    Therefore for n min = 6 * n

# How to Calculate Formula for seconds:
    60 Seconds ---> 360 Deg
    Therefore for n seconds = 6 * n
